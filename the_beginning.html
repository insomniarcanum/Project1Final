    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        now hold on
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        this isn't a race thing
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        or a trans thing
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        these are just fundamental to who i am
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and how i navigate the world.
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i didn't realize it in the beginning
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i thought those things couldn't be further apart
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i couldn't fathom how my transness
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and my blackness
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        would intertwine
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        <a href="puzzle.html">like pieces falling into place</a>
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        but they did. and they do.
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        when i was younger
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i didn't have space
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        to be both trans and black
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i only had space for one at a time
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and since i can't take my skin off
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        my blackness always
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        won out.
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        my parents raised me to be curious
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        so when the first inkling
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        of something strange arose
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i began investigating
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        lo and behold, i wasn't alone
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        in my transness, that is
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        there wasn't space for
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        black people on the internet
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        back then
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and being trans was almost just as bad
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i remember the firs time
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i came out to my mom
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        she reacted horribly
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        or because she didn't accept me
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        it was because she was afraid.
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        that her little black girl
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        would suddenly be seen
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        as the "big black man"
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        that serves as the face of violence
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and crime
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and pain
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and death
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and death
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        she was afraid i'd be killed sooner
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        she didn't think
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        she had to worry with daughters
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        but black boys were ripe
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        for the picking at any age
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        in the eyes of an officer
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i didn't know that then, though
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        at that moment
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i was trying to carve out a space
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        for my transness within my blackness
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and it didn't happen
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i don't think you get wiser with age
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i think you get wiser with experience
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        like when you're in high school
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and you feel like you know everything
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i won't say you know nothing
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        but, hopefully, you don't know a lot
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        because the quickest way people learn
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        is through pain
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and i remember the pain in my neck
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        when i was pushed to the kitchen floor
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i remember my mom was angry
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        because i didn't do the dishes
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and i didn't do the dishes
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        because she refused to acknowledge me
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        as her son
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and i didn't do the dishes
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        she taught me to never
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        let someone disrespect me
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        i guess she didn't expect it to extend to her
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i started washing them reluctantly
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        but she's a stubborn woman
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and she tried to move me
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        she also taught me
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        to stand firm on things
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and i guess she didn't expect it
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        to extend to her
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        when she couldn't shove me from in front of the sink
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        she grabbed my hair
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and a knife
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i lost my balance
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and we both fell
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        i remember the pain in my neck
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        when i was pushed to the floor
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        with a knife to my chest
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and i remember her words
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        "i brought you into this world"
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        she said
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        "i can take you out"
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and i learned
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        in that moment
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        in that pain
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        that my blackness
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        and my transness
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        couldn't coexist
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        because people around me
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        didn't make space for it
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        becuase their love fell away to fear
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and their fear was suffocating
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        to them, and me
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        "do it", i said
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        "i don't want to be here anyways"
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        in that moment, i chose ot make room
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        for my two identities to coexist
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and i chose to make it clear
    </div>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        to the person i loved the most
    </div>
    <div div class="rightdiv">
        and to the person i feared the most
    </div>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <div div class="leftdiv">
        that no one was going to stop me
